# Lagrange-Multiplier

A Python utility for solving **constrained optimization problems** using the **Lagrange Multiplier method**.  

This tool leverages [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/) to symbolically compute solutions to optimization problems of the form:  

min f(x1, x2, ..., xn)   subject to   g(x1, x2, ..., xn) = 0

## ✨ Features
- Symbolic optimization with **Lagrange multipliers**
- Supports multiple variables
- Returns solutions including the **Lagrange multiplier**
- Easy to extend for more constraints

## ⚙️ Function Signature

```python
lagrange_multiplier(objective, constraint, variables)
```
